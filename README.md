# 🚀 Mars Rover Spoked Wheel Design 

## Overview  
This project presents a **spoked wheel design** optimized for **ERC (European Rover Challenge) and URC (University Rover Challenge)**. The design ensures **stability, traction, and adaptability** for Mars-like terrain, addressing challenges such as **sinking in soft soil, slippage, and high-speed mobility over obstacles**.  

Developed in **SolidWorks**, the project includes CAD files, a detailed report with justifications, and an animation of the wheel assembly.  

## Features  
- **Optimized for Mars-like terrain**: Handles soft soil, minimizes slippage, and improves traction.  
- **Material Selection**:  
  - **Spokes & Base**: **Aluminum** for lightweight strength.  
  - **Tire**: **Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR)** for flexibility and durability.  
- **Complete Design Package**:  
  - ✅ **CAD files (.sldprt, .stepAP214)**  
  - ✅ **Engineering report (PDF) with justifications and references**  
  - ✅ **Exploded assembly animation/screen recording**  
- **All components available for purchase online in BD**
